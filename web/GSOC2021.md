# An object detection component for LearnBlock

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to develop a component to detect object that can be used by LearnBlock. As the other components work with the RoboComp, also the new component will use it. The principal function of the component is given an image get a list of predictions with their corresponding boxes and labels that have a higher score than the threshold of the componenent. This threshold can be accessed using its getter and setter provided by the interface of the component.

## Remarks

The integration of the component in LearnBlock cannot be done, as in the final steps of the project the time was running out and the integration of the component could cause some errors in LearnBlock if it was done with hurry. Althought, the component is perfectly functional and works properly.
